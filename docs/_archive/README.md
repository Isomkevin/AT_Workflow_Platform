# Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived documentation files that have been consolidated into the main documentation structure.

## Archived Files

- **PREVIEW.md**: Preview/development guide - content consolidated into main documentation
- **QUICKSTART.md**: Quick start guide - content consolidated into main README and documentation

## Why Archived?

These files contained valuable information but had significant overlap with other documentation. Their content has been:

1. Consolidated into the canonical documentation structure in `/docs`
2. Integrated into the root README.md
3. Preserved here for historical reference

## Current Documentation

See the main [Documentation Index](../README.md) for the current, consolidated documentation.
